# Is_X_length_Py_3
Function takes a string named _sentence_ and an integer named _x_ as parameters. It returns _True_ if every word in sentence has a length greater than or equal to _x_.

## General info
The purpose of the project is just personal learning. I save this code as I may revisit this code in the future to find different solutions or to apply it under other context. 

## Description
Function x_length_words takes a string named _sentence_ and an integer named _x_ as parameters. 

First it splits the sentence to get each word as a separate entity, in a list named _splited_sentence_, and then compares each word's length with x. If it is less than x it will return False. 

It returns _True_ if every word in sentence has a length greater than or equal to _x_.
